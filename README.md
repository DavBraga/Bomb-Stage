# Unity Project - Bomb Stage

This project is a Unity game created for my Dio course. It features a single-player adaptation of a Stumble Guys stage, providing an exciting and enjoyable gaming experience.

The game is built using various game development concepts, including Shader Graphs, Unity Particle System, State Machines, physics and math for games. The game also features a custom-made third-person character controller supported by Cinemachine, making the gameplay even more immersive.
